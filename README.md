<p align="justify">I am a full-stack software engineer with 10 years of coding experience.</p>

<p align="justify">I have been working as a full-stack engineer since graduation from the university and started as a FrontEnd developer making simple static web pages and expanding my knowledge over time. While working as a software engineer I paved my full-stack engineer career and demonstrated my knowledge and intelligence by building more than 20 websites utilizing various modern web technologies such as MERN/Python/Vue/Angular stack.</p>

<p align="justify">My goal with coding is to benefit people and their businesses with my tools and applications. I enjoy being able to create something outstanding that implements market needs and trends. </p>
